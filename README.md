REST API

Technology stack:
Java 11,Spring Boot,Spring DATA JPA,MySQL,Spring Web

Description of the completed task:
Web API for entering data into the database.

And so I created a PROJECT entity object and connected it to another TASK entity object through OneToMany and ManyToOne, that is, there can be several tasks in one project, I did not specify the int priority for Enum and did it simply through ORDINAL, which displays the enumeration by numbering through int .
I have tested this web API through Postman.

Note:
I haven't come across the Docker tool.
My attempts to deploy this project in a Docker container were in vain.
Therefore, he is not here.
